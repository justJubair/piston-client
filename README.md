- There are six different brands, each brand has an own page dedicated to them. Each brand page has a slider and products according to the brand.
- You can update each an every product on specific brands, but you've to logged in to do so. 
- There's a details button on every product, clicking on that button will take you to a details page of that specific product. Detail page has a add to cart button, this button will store the product in the database and display your added products in the my cart page.
